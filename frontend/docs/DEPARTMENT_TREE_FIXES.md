# Department Tree View Fixes - Summary

## Date: 2025-08-19

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Parent Department Combobox Issue ✅
**Problem**: When editing a department from the tree view, the parent department combobox was not showing the correct parent data.

**Root Cause**: The `parentId` was not being passed when calling the edit function from the tree view.

**Solution**:
- Updated `DepartmentTree.tsx` to pass `parentId` and `schoolId` props to `TreeNode` component
- Modified `TreeNode` interface to include `parentId` and `schoolId` parameters
- Updated the edit action to include `parentId` when creating the Department object
- Fixed `DepartmentsPage.tsx` to preserve `department.parentId` when editing

### 2. Visual Hierarchy Improvements ✅
**Enhancement**: Improved the visual representation of the department hierarchy in the tree view.

**Changes Implemented**:

#### Color-Coded Hierarchy Levels
- **Level 0 (Root)**: Blue theme
  - Background: Blue gradient (from-blue-50)
  - Icon: Blue (text-blue-600)
  - Border: Blue (border-blue-500)
  
- **Level 1 (First-level children)**: Green theme
  - Background: Green gradient (from-green-50)
  - Icon: Green (text-green-600)
  - Border: Green (border-green-500)
  - Indentation: 2rem (ml-8)
  
- **Level 2+ (Deeper levels)**: Purple theme
  - Background: Purple gradient (from-purple-50)
  - Icon: Purple (text-purple-600)
  - Border: Purple (border-purple-500)
  - Indentation: 4rem (ml-16)

#### Connection Lines
- Added visual connection lines between parent and child nodes
- Vertical gradient lines showing hierarchy relationships
- Rounded corner connectors from parent to child nodes

#### Enhanced UI Elements
- Improved stats display with badge-style containers
- Added hover effects with slight scale transformation
- Sub-department count indicator when collapsed (orange badge)
- Better spacing and padding for improved readability

## Files Modified

### 1. `/src/components/organization/DepartmentTree.tsx`
```typescript
// Added props to TreeNode interface
interface TreeNodeProps {
  node: DepartmentTreeDto;
  level: number;
  parentId?: string;  // Added
  schoolId?: string;  // Added
  // ... other props
}

// Updated TreeNode component to pass parentId correctly
<DropdownMenuItem onClick={() => onEdit?.({
  id: node.id,
  // ... other fields
  parentId: parentId,  // Now correctly passed
  schoolId: schoolId,  // Now correctly passed
  // ...
})}>
```

### 2. `/src/app/(authenticated)/organization/departments/page.tsx`
```typescript
// Fixed handleEditDepartment to preserve parentId
const handleEditDepartment = (department: Department) => {
  setEditingDepartment(department);
  setParentDepartmentId(department.parentId);  // Now correctly preserves parentId
  setIsDepartmentFormOpen(true);
};
```

## Testing Instructions

1. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Navigate to Department Tree View**:
   - Open http://localhost:3001
   - Go to Organization > Departments
   - Click on "Tree View" tab

3. **Test Parent Department Fix**:
   - Click the three-dot menu on any sub-department
   - Select "Edit"
   - Verify the parent department combobox shows the correct parent
   - Cancel or save the form

4. **Test Visual Improvements**:
   - Observe color-coded hierarchy levels (blue → green → purple)
   - Check connection lines between nodes
   - Expand/collapse nodes to see sub-department count badges
   - Hover over nodes to see the subtle scale effect

5. **Test CRUD Operations**:
   - Add a new root department
   - Add a sub-department (verify parent is pre-selected)
   - Edit departments (verify parent data is correct)
   - Delete a department (verify confirmation dialog)

## Backend Considerations

The hierarchy endpoint (`/v1/hierarchy/org-chart`) has been fixed in the frontend to match the actual backend endpoint. No backend changes were required.

## Status

✅ **COMPLETED** - All fixes have been successfully implemented and are ready for testing.

## Next Steps

1. Test all functionality as per the test checklist
2. Verify fixes work across different browsers
3. Check responsive design on mobile devices
4. Consider adding unit tests for the TreeNode component
5. Monitor for any performance issues with large department trees
