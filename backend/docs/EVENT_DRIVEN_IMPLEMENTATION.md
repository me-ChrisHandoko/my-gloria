# Event-Driven Architecture Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented Event-Driven Architecture for the approval workflow system, enabling asynchronous, decoupled communication between different parts of the application.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Event System Structure

#### Event Types (`approval.events.ts`)
```typescript
export enum ApprovalEventType {
  REQUEST_CREATED = 'approval.request.created',
  REQUEST_UPDATED = 'approval.request.updated',
  REQUEST_APPROVED = 'approval.request.approved',
  REQUEST_REJECTED = 'approval.request.rejected',
  REQUEST_CANCELLED = 'approval.request.cancelled',
  REQUEST_COMPLETED = 'approval.request.completed',
  
  STEP_APPROVED = 'approval.step.approved',
  STEP_REJECTED = 'approval.step.rejected',
  STEP_SKIPPED = 'approval.step.skipped',
  STEP_DELEGATED = 'approval.step.delegated',
  
  DELEGATION_CREATED = 'approval.delegation.created',
  DELEGATION_ACTIVATED = 'approval.delegation.activated',
  DELEGATION_EXPIRED = 'approval.delegation.expired',
  
  WORKFLOW_STARTED = 'approval.workflow.started',
  WORKFLOW_COMPLETED = 'approval.workflow.completed',
  WORKFLOW_FAILED = 'approval.workflow.failed',
}
```

#### Event Classes
- Base `ApprovalEvent` class with common properties
- Specific event classes for each event type with relevant payload
- Correlation ID support for event tracking

### 2. Event Handlers (`approval.event-handlers.ts`)

#### Handler Implementation
- `ApprovalEventHandlers` service with dedicated handlers for each event type
- Integration with notification service for real-time updates
- Audit logging for all events
- Cache invalidation for data consistency

#### Key Features:
- **Request Created Handler**: Notifies next approvers, logs audit trail
- **Request Approved Handler**: Checks completion status, notifies next approvers or requester
- **Request Rejected Handler**: Notifies requester and pending approvers
- **Step Handlers**: Manages step-level approvals and sequence progression
- **Workflow Handlers**: Tracks workflow lifecycle and metrics
- **Delegation Handlers**: Manages delegation notifications and activation

### 3. Event Emitter Integration

#### Module Configuration
```typescript
EventEmitterModule.forRoot({
  wildcard: true,
  delimiter: '.',
  maxListeners: 10,
  verboseMemoryLeak: true,
})
```

#### WorkflowService Integration
- Event emission in `initiateWorkflow()` method
- Event emission in `processApproval()` method
- Correlation ID generation for tracking related events
- Events emitted after successful transaction completion

### 4. Notification Service Integration

#### Enhanced NotificationService
- Added `send()` method for simplified event handler usage
- Dynamic mapping of event types to notification types
- Support for priority levels and multiple channels
- Integration with existing notification queue system

### 5. Audit Service Enhancement

#### Simplified Audit Logging
- Added `logAction()` method for event handlers
- Automatic module detection
- Comprehensive metadata tracking
- Correlation ID support for event tracing

## Benefits Achieved

### 1. **Loose Coupling**
- Workflow logic separated from notification logic
- Services communicate through events, not direct calls
- Easy to add new event handlers without modifying core logic

### 2. **Scalability**
- Asynchronous event processing
- Can handle high volume of approval requests
- Easy to scale individual components

### 3. **Reliability**
- Events emitted after transaction completion
- Error handling in event handlers doesn't affect main flow
- Retry mechanism through notification queue

### 4. **Observability**
- Comprehensive audit trail through events
- Correlation IDs for tracking event chains
- Detailed logging for debugging

### 5. **Extensibility**
- Easy to add new event types
- Simple to add new handlers for existing events
- Can integrate with external systems through events

## Testing Verification

### Build Success
✅ All TypeScript compilation successful
✅ No type errors in event system
✅ Proper dependency injection configured

### Server Startup
✅ EventEmitterModule properly initialized
✅ Event handlers registered successfully
✅ No runtime errors on startup

### Integration Points
✅ NotificationService properly integrated
✅ AuditService properly integrated
✅ CacheService properly integrated
✅ PrismaService properly integrated

## Future Enhancements

### 1. **Event Store**
- Implement event sourcing for complete history
- Add event replay capability
- Enable time-travel debugging

### 2. **External Integration**
- Webhook support for external systems
- Message queue integration (RabbitMQ/Kafka)
- Real-time WebSocket notifications

### 3. **Advanced Features**
- Event aggregation and analytics
- Complex event processing (CEP)
- Event-driven sagas for complex workflows

### 4. **Monitoring**
- Event metrics and dashboards
- Alert on event processing failures
- Performance tracking for event handlers

## Usage Example

When a new approval request is created:
1. WorkflowService creates request in transaction
2. Emits `RequestCreatedEvent` and `WorkflowStartedEvent`
3. Event handlers automatically:
   - Send notifications to approvers
   - Create audit logs
   - Update cache
   - Track workflow metrics

When an approval is processed:
1. WorkflowService updates approval step
2. Emits appropriate events (`StepApprovedEvent`, `RequestApprovedEvent`, etc.)
3. Event handlers automatically:
   - Notify next approvers or requester
   - Update audit trail
   - Clear relevant caches
   - Track completion metrics

## Conclusion

The Event-Driven Architecture implementation successfully addresses the requirements from the IMPROVE_APPROVAL.md document, providing a robust foundation for scalable, maintainable, and observable approval workflows.
