# UUID v7 Migration Report

## Summary
All UUID generation in the backend has been successfully migrated to use UUID v7 (`import { v7 as uuidv7 } from 'uuid';`).

## Benefits of UUID v7
- **Time-ordered**: UUIDs are sortable by creation time
- **Better database performance**: Sequential nature improves B-tree index performance
- **Timestamp embedded**: Contains creation timestamp information
- **Uniqueness guaranteed**: Same collision resistance as UUID v4

## Files Updated

### 1. `/src/common/interceptors/request-tracking.interceptor.ts`
- **Changed**: `import { v4 as uuidv4 } from 'uuid';` → `import { v7 as uuidv7 } from 'uuid';`
- **Usage**: Request ID generation for tracking HTTP requests
- **Impact**: All request IDs will now be time-sortable

### 2. `/src/common/decorators/log.decorator.ts`
- **Changed**: `Math.random().toString(36).substring(7)` → `uuidv7()`
- **Added**: `import { v7 as uuidv7 } from 'uuid';`
- **Usage**: Request ID generation in logging decorator
- **Impact**: Better traceability with standard UUID format

## Database Considerations

### Prisma Schema
- **Current**: Using `@default(cuid())` for ID generation
- **Note**: CUID is already time-sortable and optimized for databases
- **Recommendation**: Keep CUID for database IDs as it's already optimal

## Package Information
- **Package**: `uuid` version `11.1.0`
- **Support**: Full UUID v7 support included
- **No additional packages required**

## Testing
- ✅ Build successful
- ✅ TypeScript compilation passed
- ✅ No breaking changes

## Best Practices Going Forward
1. Always use `import { v7 as uuidv7 } from 'uuid';` for new UUID generation
2. Use `uuidv7()` for request IDs, correlation IDs, and tracking
3. Keep `cuid()` in Prisma schema for database primary keys
4. Avoid `Math.random()` for ID generation
